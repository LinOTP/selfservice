linotp-selfservice (1.0~rc1-1) buster-dev; urgency=medium

  Features:
  * Permissions are refreshed on every page load after the main requests are
    done. Previously this was only done once after successful login.
  * Token list is registered as the fallback route that is redirected to if no
    other route was hit.

  Fixes:
  * Push and qr token activation was wrongly reported as failed in 1.0rc0.
    This is now fixed and the activation process is correctly performed.
  * Non-fully activated push and qr tokens are handled equally now in the token
    list. This means that push tokens no longer show a primary delete action
    and the wording reflects whether the activation permission was granted or
    not.
  * Push and qr token enrollment dialog now only allows to start activation if
    the correct permission was granted.
  * Push and qr token enrollment dialog now correctly handles the links to the
    mobile apps and for pairing.
  * Side margins are no longer missing on smaller screens. A minimal side
    margin is retained on screens smaller than the max-width of the token list.
  * History search is no longer submitted implicitly when the pagination or
    sort order changes. The user now has to explicitly submit the search once
    it is happy with the selected column and search term. The "clear search"
    icon button is shown if the table does not show the unfiltered search. The
    search button is now only shown if the search form has changes that are not
    submitted.
  * Cancelling Push and QR token activation no longer opens a pop-up informing
    of a successful activation.
  * Prevent multiple submission of login requests in rapid succession
  * Push token MFA login UI is now correctly aligned.
  * Cancelling Push and QR token activation now directly cancels status
    polling.

linotp-selfservice (1.0~rc0-1) buster-dev; urgency=medium

  Features:
  * Support for enrollHMAC and enrollTOTP policies. These policies are now the
    preferred way of enabling TOTP and HOTP token enrollment.
  * Enhanced support for Yubikey and Yubico tokens in MFA login.
  * Name and realm of logged-in user is displayed in the top bar.
  * Enhanced consitency between all dialogs for the enrollment of all supported
    token types.
  * API polling for status checks is now slowing down with exponential backoff
    after some time for less load on the backend.
  * If a token is disabled without having the permission to reenable the token,
    it must be confirmed with a dialog.
  * The disable token action is no longer shown at all if permission is not
    available but the enable token action is shown disabled with a tooltip
    explaining that the user is not allowed to reenable disabled tokens.
  * QR and Push tokens show an improved information if they are not yet paired
    based on the permissions a user has.
  * Unsupported browser message includes link to legacy Self Service.
  * Display user history in a data table, provided the history policy is set.

  Breaking changes:
  * The debian package now builds the selfservice to be available on the url
    "/selfservice" instead of "/selfservice-v2" in preparation for being the
    primary selfservice for LinOTP.

  Deprecations:
  * Policies "webprovisionGOOGLE" and "webprovisionGOOGLEtime" are replaced by
    "enrollHMAC" and "enrollTOTP" respectively. They are still available for
    compatibility reasons when running the legacy Self Service in parallel.

  Fixes:
  * Apache config files are now correctly linked into "/etc/linotp/" which was
    previously "/etc/linotp2/" with LinOTP 2.x.
  * Login redirect to the token list can no longer fail because of redirect
    paramter stacking up mulitple times pointing to the login page.
  * Tokens with a pending activation will no longer show an empty token action
    card if only actions are allowed that are only viable for fully-activated
    tokens.
  * Assigning a password token when the verify permission is set now correctly
    opens the token test to verify that the user can use the token now.
  * Pressing enter after successfully creating tokens no longer causes
    unintential duplicated tokens from being created.
  * The enrollment grid now is ensured to be always shown if a token enrollment
    policy is set. Also the section will no longer be mistakenly shown if the
    verify policy is set but no enrollment policies are.
  * No longer recognizing a MFA-login session as a valid session in
    SessionService.
